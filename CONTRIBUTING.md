Thank you for contributing!

The rest of this document will focus on code contributions to this repository.

## Assumptions

This document assumes that you:
1. Have basic familiarity with [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git) and the [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) workflow.
1. Have read some of the [Chaos Genius documentation](https://docs.chaosgenius.io).
1. Know about the [Chaos Genius community](https://docs.chaosgenius.io/docs/introduction#community). Please reach out to us for any help!

## Contributing

Follow these steps if you want to make a code contribution to Chaos Genius.

1. Find an [issue](https://github.com/chaos-genius/chaos_genius/issues) that you want to work on. If an issue does not exist for your problem, please create one.
    - Leave a comment on the issue indicating that you want to work on it.
    - Wait for one of the maintainers to confirm and provide more details on it (if required).
1. Clone the repository (you will need to create a [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) if you're an external contributor).
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/chaos-genius/chaos_genius.git
    cd chaos_genius
    ```
1. Create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
    - If you're an internal contributor, the branch must be named appropriately. Use `feature/` or `fix/` prefix as needed. An example of a good branch name is `feature/add-prophet-model`.
1. See [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) for setting up Chaos Genius locally and testing your changes.
1. Commit your changes while following the [commit guidelines](#git-commit-messages).
1. Open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) from your branch.
    - The PR must be directed to the `develop` branch (and not the `main` branch).
    - A maintainer will soon add appropriate tags and milestones.
    - Once your change is approved and the PR is merged, it will be available in the next release of Chaos Genius.

## Development Workflow

### Backend/API

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 with `venv`
- A PostgreSQL server
- A Redis server

#### Steps to set up a development environment

- Create a new python virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
- Install the development requirements.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    ```
- Copy `.env.local.template` to `.env.local` and set appropriate variables.
    ```
    cp .env.local.template .env.local
    ```
    - In particular, you will need to change:
        - `DATABASE_URL_CG_DB` - change username, password, DB host and DB name as needed.
        - `CHAOSGENIUS_WEBAPP_URL` - this is the URL used in emails. For local dev setups, this can be `http://localhost:5000`.
        - `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` and `CELERY_BROKER_URL` - change the Redis host name as needed.
- Run the following command to start a local API server:
    ```
    bash dev_server.sh
    ```
- Note: this does not start any of the celery schedulers or workers, which are needed if you want to run any analytics.

### Frontend/UI/Webapp

#### Prerequisites

- Node JS

#### Steps to set up a development environment

- The webapp is present in the `frontend` directory.
    ```
    cd frontend
    ```
- Install dependencies.
    ```
    npm i
    ```
- Create a `.env` file (while inside the `frontend` directory) and add the following to it (this is the URL of the API server):
    ```
    REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```
- Start a local server.
    ```
    npm start
    ```
- A browser window should open at http://localhost:3000 with the webapp.

## Git guidelines

### Git commit messages

We will use Semantic Commit Messages, that are an adoption of Conventional Commits:

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

#### Description of each commit type:

1. feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
2. fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
3. docs: (changes to the documentation)
4. style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
5. refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
6. test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
7. chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

Please look into Semantic Commitâ€™s references for more information. 

#### A good thumb rule:

Commit message should talk about WHAT changed, and WHY. Not HOW â€“ how is the diff, and you donâ€™t need to repeat it.

### GitHub Pull Requests

- Describe your changes in the PR description. It can have minimal information if the commits describe the changes instead.
- Add the `don't merge` label if your PR is in-progress.
